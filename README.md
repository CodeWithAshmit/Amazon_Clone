## ðŸ“‚ Code Structure  

amazon-clone/
â”‚â”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML file

How It Works

1.The HTML file defines the structure using <header>, <section>, <div>, and <footer> elements.

2.The navigation bar is designed using Flexbox for proper alignment.

3.The hero section uses a large background image with a text overlay.

4.The product sections use CSS Grid to display multiple categories.

5.Hover effects and transitions are applied using CSS for better interactivity.

6.The footer is styled to resemble Amazonâ€™s multi-column layout.
